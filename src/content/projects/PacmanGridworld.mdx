A final project that I worked on in highschool. Using Java and the Gridworld package, I recreated the Pacman game with randomized ghost movement, a scoring system, and power pellets. This was one of my first programming projects, and it was a great opportunity for me to apply what I had learned in class to a fun and engaging project.
