An exploration of the infinite passing drill in rugby which is a common warmup exercise (more details in the repository below). While there is no substantial practical application, I find the challenge of solving this phenomenon to be an interesting exercise in mathematics/algorithms. I have been contributing to this project on and off over the years, and hope to learn more as I continue to work on it.
