An exploration of the infinite passing drill in rugby and the nature of "player oscillations" and how they occur (more details in the repository). While there is no substantial practical application, I find the exploration of this to be an interesting exercise in algorithms.

## Features

- A Pygame simulation of the drill to visualize passing patterns and player oscillations.
- An algorithm to find if a player oscillation occurs and calculate the number of passes before the oscillation in addition to which lines the player oscillates between.
- A brute force approach which was initially used to gain insight into the problem
- Lemmas and proofs about the nature of player oscillations in the drill
- Support for command line arguments to customize the drill and/or visualization 
    - includes using yaml files for greater flexibility
