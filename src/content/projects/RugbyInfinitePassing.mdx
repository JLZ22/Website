An exploration of the infinite passing drill in rugby and the nature of "player oscillations" (click this box for more details). While there is no substantial practical application, I find the exploration of this phenomenon to be an interesting exercise in mathematics/algorithms. I have been contributing to this project on and off over the years, and hope to learn more as I continue to work on it.
