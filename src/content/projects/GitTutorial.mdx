This is a tutorial I created to help new users understand the basics of Git. I have been working on this project since March 2024, and I hope to continue updating it as I learn more about Git and receive feedback from people who come across this tutorial. It covers topics such as creating a repository, making commits, pushing changes to a remote repository, branching, stashing, and authentication with GitHub. Currently, it is just a Markdown file, but I plan to expand it into an interactive tutorial as I continue to work on it.
