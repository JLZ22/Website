As a part of a project in highschool, I built a simple Pascal compiler capable of function definition and calls, variable storage, and basic arithmetic operations. The compiler was written in Java and generated MIPS assembly code. We used abstract syntax trees to represent the structure of the Pascal code and implemented a recursive descent parser to generate the assembly code. The project was a great learning experience for me, as it helped me understand the basics of compilers and how programming languages are translated into machine code.
