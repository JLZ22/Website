Developed a compiler for the SimpleC language, a subset of C with types long, long*, char*, char**, and void. The compiler generates x86-64 assembly code to produce executable files. Implemented parsing and code generation for arithmetic expressions, logical operations, and control flow structures (if/while/for). Implemented support for argument parsing, variable declarations, and recursive function calls.
