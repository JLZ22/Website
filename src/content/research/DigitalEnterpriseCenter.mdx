I am currently working as a student researcher for the Digital Enterprise Center at Purdue to build a software demo for automated assembly verification in factories that employ human workers. This involves foreign object debris (FOD) detection, validation of assembly steps, and data collection. <br/><br/>
Note: Because the project is still in development, the repositories are not available to the public per my employer's instruction.
